# {.tabset}

## Overview

In this practical, you'll practice grouping and analysing data with the `dplyr` and `tidyr` packages (part of the `tidyverse collection of packages).

By the end of this practical you will know how to:

1. Group data and calculate summary statistics
2. Run statistical analyses with the generalised linear model.

## Tasks

### A - Setup

1. Open your `BaselRBootcamp` R project. It should already have the folders `1_Data` and `2_Code`. Make sure that the data files listed in the `Datasets` section above are in your `1_Data` folder.

```{r}
# Done!
```

2. Open a new R script. At the top of the script, using comments, write your name and the date. Save it as a new file called `analysing_practical.R` in the `2_Code` folder.  

3. Using `library()` load the packages `tidyverse` and `broom` which you'll use in this practical

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
```

3. For this practical, we'll use the `kc_house.csv` data. This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, Washington. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. Using the following template, load the data into R and store it as a new object called `kc_house`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
kc_house <- read_csv(file = "XX/XX")
```

4. Using `print()`, `summary()`, `head()`, and `View()`, explore the data to make sure it was loaded correctly.

```{r}
kc_house
summary(kc_house)
head(kc_house)
# View(kc_house)
```

### B - Recap

1. Print the names of the `kc_house` data with `names()`.

```{r}
names(kc_house)
```

2. Change the following column names using `rename()`.

|New Name | Old Name|
|:----|:----|
|living_sqft|sqft_living |
|lot_sqft|sqft_lot |
|above_sqft|sqft_above |
|basement_sqft|sqft_basement |
|built_yr|yr_built |
|renovated_yr|yr_renovated|

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
kc_house <- kc_house %>%
  rename(NEW = OLD,
         NEW = OLD,
         NEW = OLD)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
kc_house <- kc_house %>%
  rename(living_sqft = sqft_living,
         lot_sqft = sqft_lot,
         above_sqft = sqft_above,
         basement_sqft = sqft_basement,
         built_yr = yr_built,
         renovated_yr = yr_renovated)
```

3. Create new column(s) `living_sqm`, `lot_sqm`, `above_sqm` and `basement_sqm` which show  the respective room sizes in square meters rather than square feet (Hint: Multiply each by 0.093).

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
kc_house <- kc_house %>%
  mutate(living_sqm = XXX * XXX,
         lot_sqm = XXX * XXX,
         XXX = XXX,
         XXX = XXX)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE}
kc_house <- kc_house %>%
  mutate(living_sqm = living_sqft * 0.093,
         lot_sqm = lot_sqft * 0.093,
         above_sqm = above_sqft * 0.093,
         basement_sqm  = basement_sqft * 0.093)
```

4. Add a new variable to the dataframe called `mansion` which is "Yes" when the *sum* of the house's living, above, and basement space is above 750 square meters.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
kc_house <- kc_house %>%
                mutate(XXX = case_when(
                              XXX + XXX + XXX > XXX ~ "XXX",
                              XXXX + XXX + XXX <= XXX ~ "XXX"))
```

```{r, eval = TRUE}
kc_house <- kc_house %>%
                mutate(mansion = case_when(
                              living_sqm + above_sqm +  basement_sqm > 750 ~ "Yes",
                              living_sqm + above_sqm + basement_sqm <= 750 ~ "No"))
```

### C - Simple summaries

1. Using the base-R `df$col` notation, calculate the mean price of all houses.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mean(XXX$XXX)
```

```{r}
mean(kc_house$price)
```

2. Now, do the same using `summarise()` using the following template. Do you get the same answer? What is different about the output from `summarise()` versus using the dollar sign?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
kc_house %>%
  summarise(
    price_mean = mean(XXX)
  )
```

```{r}
kc_house %>%
  summarise(
    price_mean = mean(price)
  )
```

3. What is the *median* price of all houses? Use the `median()` function!

```{r}
kc_house %>%
  summarise(
    price_median = median(price)
  )
```

4. What was the highest selling price? Use the `max()` function!

```{r}
kc_house %>%
  summarise(
    price_max = max(price)
  )
```

5. Using the following template, sort the data frame in descending order of price. Then, print it. Do you see the house with the highest selling price at the top?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
kc_house <- kc_house %>%
  arrange(desc(XXX))

kc_house
```

```{r}
kc_house <- kc_house %>%
  arrange(desc(price))

kc_house
```

6. What percentage of houses sold for more than 1,000,000? Let's answer this with `summarise()`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
kc_house %>%
  summarise(mil_p = mean(XXX > 1000000))
```

```{r}
kc_house %>%
  summarise(mil_p = mean(price > 1000000))
```

7. For mansions *only*, calculate the mean number of floors and bathrooms (hint: before summarising the data, use `filter()` to only select mansions!)

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
kc_house %>%
  filter(XXX == XXX) %>%
  summarise(
    floors_mean = XXX(XXX),
    bathrooms_mean = XXX(XXX)
  )
```


```{r}
kc_house %>%
  filter(mansion == "Yes") %>%
  summarise(
    floors_mean = mean(floors),
    bathrooms_mean = mean(bathrooms)
  )
```

### D - Simple grouped summaries

1. How many mansions are there? To do this, use `group_by()` to group the dataset by the `mansions` column, then use the `n()` function to count the number of cases.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
kc_house %>%
  group_by(XXX) %>%
  summarise(XXX = n())
```

```{r}
kc_house %>%
  group_by(mansion) %>%
  summarise(N = n())
```

2. What is the mean selling price of mansions versus non-mansions? To do this, just add another argument to your `summarise()` function!

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
kc_house %>%
  group_by(mansion) %>%
  summarise(N = n(),
            XXX = XXX(XXX))
```

```{r}
kc_house %>%
  group_by(mansion) %>%
  summarise(N = n(),
            price_mean = mean(price))
```

3. Using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, create a dataframe showing the same results as the following table.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, results = 'asis'}
kc_house %>%
  group_by(mansion) %>%
  summarise(N = n(),
            price_min = min(price),
            price_mean = mean(price),
            price_median = median(price),
            price_max = max(price)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

4. Do houses built in later years tend to have more living space? To answer this, group the data by `built_yr`, and then calculate the mean number of living square meters. Be sure to also include the number of houses built in each year!

```{r}
kc_house %>%
  group_by(built_yr) %>%
  summarise(N = n(),
            living = mean(living_sqm))
```

5. Was that table too big? Try using the following code to get the results for each decade rather than each year!

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
kc_house %>%
  mutate(built_decade = floor(built_yr / 10)) %>%
  group_by(built_decade) %>%
  summarise(XX = XX,
            XX = XX(XX))
```

6. A friend of yours who is getting into Seattle real estate wants to know how the number of floors a house has affects its selling price. Create a table for her showing the minimum, mean, and maximum price for houses separated by the number of floors they have.

### E - Multiple groups

1. Your friend Brumhilda is interested in statistics on houses in the following 4 zipcodes only: 98001, 98109, 98117, 98199.  Create a new dataframe called `brumhilda` that only contains data from houses in those zipcode (hint: use `filter()` combined with the `%in%` operator as follows:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
brumhilda <- kc_house %>%
  filter(XXX %in% c(XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX))
```

```{r}
brumhilda <- kc_house %>%
  filter(zipcode %in% c(98001, 98109, 98117, 98199))
```

2. For each of the zip codes, calculate the `mean()` and `median()` selling price (as well as the number of houses) in each zip code.

```{r}
brumhilda %>%
  group_by(zipcode) %>%
  summarise(price_mean = mean(price),
           price_median = median(price),
           N = n())
```

3. Now Brumhilda wants the same data separated by whether or not the house is a mansion or not. Include these results by also grouping the data by `mansion` (as well as `zipcode`), and calculating the same summary statistics as before.

```{r}
brumhilda %>%
  group_by(zipcode, mansion) %>%
  summarise(price_mean = mean(price),
           price_median = median(price),
           N = n())
```


4. Ok that was good, but now she also wants to know what the maximum and minimum number of floors were in each group. Add these summary statistics!

```{r}
brumhilda %>%
  group_by(zipcode) %>%
  summarise(price_mean = mean(price),
           price_median = median(price),
           floors_min = min(floors),
           floors_max = max(floors),
           N = n())
```


### F - Statistics

1. Let's see if there is a significant difference between the selling prices of houses on the waterfront versus those not on the waterfront. To do this, we'll conduct a t-test using the `t.test()` function and assign the result to `waterfront_htest`. Fill in the XXXs in the code below, such that the dependent variable is `price` and the independent variable is `waterfront`

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
waterfront_htest <- t.test(formula = XXX ~ XXX,
                           data = XXX)
```

```{r}
waterfront_htest <- t.test(formula = price ~ waterfront,
                           data = kc_house)
```

2. Print your `waterfront_htest` object to see a printout of the main results.

```{r}
waterfront_htest
```

3. Look at the names of your `waterfront_htest` object with `names()`.

```{r}
names(waterfront_htest)
```


4. Using the `$`, print the test statistic (`statistic`) from your `waterfront_htest` object.

```{r}
waterfront_htest$statistic
```


5. Now using `$`, print only the p-value (`p.value`) from the object.

```{r}
waterfront_htest$p.value
```

6. Which of the variables `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `living_sqm`,  `waterfront`, `lat` and `long` best predict a house's price (`price`)? Answer this by conducting a regression analysis using the `glm()` function and assign the result to `price_glm`. Fill in the XXXs in the code below.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
price_glm <- glm(formula = XXX ~ XXX + XXX + XXX + XXX + XXX + XXX,
                 data = XXX)
```

```{r}
price_glm <- glm(formula = price ~ bedrooms + bathrooms + living_sqm + waterfront + lat + long,
                 data = kc_house)
```

7. Print your `price_glm` object. What do you see?

```{r}
price_glm
```

8. Look at the names of your `price_glm` object with `names()`.

```{r}
names(price_glm)
```

9. Using `$` print the coefficients from your analysis.

```{r}
price_glm$coefficients
```

10. Using the `summary()` function, show summary results from your `price_glm` object.

```{r}
summary(price_glm)
```

11. The `$residuals` element in your `price_glm` object contains the residuals (difference from the predicted and true dependent variable values). Add this vector as a new column called `residuals` to your `kc_house` object using `mutate()`

```{r}
kc_house <- kc_house %>%
  mutate(residuals = price_glm$residuals)
```


12. Using the following template, create a histogram of the residuals.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = kc_house,
       aes(x = residuals)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "white") +
  labs(title = "Residual regression")
```

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = kc_house,
       aes(x = residuals)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "white") +
  labs(title = "Residual regression")
```

12. What is the mean of the residuals? How do you interpret this?

```{r}
kc_house %>% 
  summarise(resid_mean = mean(residuals))
```

13. Now, create a new column called `residuals_abs` which shows the absolute value of the residuals (hint: use the `abs()` function).

```{r}
kc_house <- kc_house %>%
  mutate(residuals_abs = abs(price_glm$residuals))
```

14. Create a histogram of the absolute value of the residuals.

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = kc_house,
       aes(x = residuals_abs)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "white") +
  labs(title = "Residual regression")
```

15. What is the mean of the absolute value of the residuals? How do you interpret this? In general, do you think you can predict the price of a house very well based on the features in your regression model?

```{r}
kc_house %>% 
  summarise(resid_abs_mean = mean(residuals_abs))

# On average, the model's fitted values are off by 144,018. So the model isn't terribly accurate on average.

```

### X - Challenges

1. Which zipcode has the highest percentage of houses on the waterfront? (Hint: group by zipcode, calculate the percentage of houses on the waterfront using `mean()`, then sort the data in descending order) with `arrange()`, then select the first row with `slice()`. Once you find it, try searching for that zipcode on Google Maps and see if its location makes sense!

```{r}
kc_house %>%
  group_by(zipcode) %>%
  summarise(waterfront_p = mean(waterfront)) %>%
  arrange(desc(waterfront_p)) %>%
  slice(1)
```

2. Which house had the highest price to living space ratio? To answer this, create a new variable called `price_to_living` that takes `price / living_sqm`. Then, sort the data in descending order of this variable, and select the first row with `slice()`! What id value do you get?

```{r}
kc_house %>%
  mutate(price_to_living = price / living_sqm) %>%
  arrange(desc(price_to_living)) %>%
  slice(1)
```

3. Which are the top 10 zip codes in terms of mean housing prices? To answer this, group the data by zipcode, calculate the mean price, arrange the dataset in descending order of mean price, then select the top 10 rows!

```{r}
kc_house %>%
  group_by(zipcode) %>%
  summarise(price_mean = mean(price)) %>%
  arrange(desc(price_mean)) %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

4. Create the following dataframe *exactly* as it appears.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
kc_house %>%
  filter(built_yr >= 1990 & built_yr < 1999) %>%
  group_by(built_yr) %>%
  summarise(N = n(),
            price_mean = mean(price),
            price_max = max(price),
            living_sqm_mean = mean(living_sqm)) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 0)
```

| built_yr|   N| price_mean| price_max| living_sqm_mean|
|--------:|---:|----------:|---------:|---------------:|
|     1990| 320|     563966|   3640900|             234|
|     1991| 224|     630441|   5300000|             244|
|     1992| 198|     548169|   2480000|             223|
|     1993| 202|     556612|   3120000|             226|
|     1994| 249|     486834|   2880500|             209|
|     1995| 169|     577771|   3200000|             224|
|     1996| 195|     639534|   3100000|             240|
|     1997| 177|     606058|   3800000|             234|
|     1998| 239|     594159|   1960000|             241|

```{r}
kc_house %>%
  filter(built_yr >= 1990 & built_yr < 1999) %>%
  group_by(built_yr) %>%
  summarise(N = n(),
            price_mean = mean(price),
            price_max = max(price),
            living_sqm_mean = mean(living_sqm)) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 0)
```

5. Create a regression object called `living_glm` predicting the amount of living space (`living_sqm`) as a function of `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `waterfront`, and `built_yr`. Explore the object with `names()` and `summary()`. Which variables seem to predict living space?

```{r}
living_glm <- glm(formula = living_sqm ~ bedrooms + bathrooms + waterfront + built_yr,
                  data = kc_house)

names(living_glm)

summary(living_glm)
```

6. The `chisq.test()` function allows you to do conduct a chi square test testing the relationship between two nominal variables. Look at the help menu to see how the function works. Then, conduct a chi-square test to see if there is a relationship between whether a house is on the waterfront and the grade of the house. Do houses on the waterfront tend to have higher (or lower) grades than houses not on the waterfront?

```{r}
# First look at a table

table(kc_house$waterfront, kc_house$grade)

chisq.test(table(kc_house$waterfront, kc_house$grade))
```
