# {.tabset}


## Overview

In this practical you'll practice specific hypothesis testing extensions of the linear model

By the end of this practical you will know how to:

1. Conduct a t-test (one sample, two sample, and paired)
2. Conduct a correlation test
3. Conduct an ANVOA
4. Conduct a chi-square test

## Tasks


### A - Setup

1. Open your `BaselRBootcamp` R project. It should already have the folders `1_Data` and `2_Code`. Make sure that the data files listed in the `Datasets` section above are in your `1_Data` folder

```{r}
# Done!
```

2. Open a new R script. At the top of the script, using comments, write your name and the date. Save it as a new file called `LinearModels_II_practical.R` in the `2_Code` folder.  

```{r}
# Done!
```

3. Using `library()` load the packages below (if you don't have them, you'll need to install them first).

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
# Load packages necessary for this script
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(rsq)
```

4. Using the following template, load the `trial_ACTG175.csv` data into R and store it as a new object called `trial` (Hint: Don't type the path directly! Use the "tab" completion!).

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Load trial_ACTG175.csv from the 1_Data folder as a new object called trial

XX <- read_csv(file = "XX/XX")
```

```{r}
# Load trial_act.csv from the 1_Data folder

trial <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/trial_ACTG175.csv")
```

5. Take a look at the first few rows of the dataset(s) by printing it/them to the console, it should look like the table below:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(trial %>% slice(1:5))
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Print trial object
XXX
```

```{r}
trial
```

7. Use the `summary()` function to print more details on the columns of the datasets.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Show summary information from trial
summary(XXX)
```

```{r}
summary(trial)
```

8. Use the `View()` function to view the entire dataframe(s) in window(s)

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# View trial dataset in new window
View(XXX)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
View(trial)
```

### B - Correlation

> Research Question:
> Is there a correlation between a patient's age and their CD4 T cell count at baseline?

1. Using the code below, create a plot showing the relationship between age and CD4 T cell count at baseline. Based on this plot, do you expect to find a relationship between the two variables? (Hint: See all of the possible named colors in R by running `colors()`. Then change the color of your histogram to your favorite one!)

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = trial, mapping = aes(x = age, y = cd4_baseline)) + 
      geom_point(alpha = .2, col = "darkblue") +
  labs(title = "ACTG175 Trial",
       subtitle = "Baseline age and CD4 T cell count at baseline ",
       x = "Age (age)",
       y = "CD4 T cell count at baseline (cd4_baseline)")
```

2. Using the `cor.test()` function, create an object called `age_cd4_baseline_test` which conducts a correlation test between a patient's age at baseline (`age`) and their CD4 T cell count at baseline (`cd4_baseline`)

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Correlation between patient's age at baseline and CD4 T cell count at baseline

XXX <- cor.test(formula = ~ XXX + XXX,
                data = XXX)
```

```{r}
# Correlation between patient's age at baseline and CD4 T cell count at baseline

age_cd4_baseline_test <- cor.test(formula = ~ age + cd4_baseline,
                          data = trial)
```

3. Print the `age_cd4_baseline_test` object to see summary outputs.

```{r}
age_cd4_baseline_test
```

4. Apply the `names()` function to your `age_cd4_baseline_test` object to see all of its named elements

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# See all named elements of age_cd4_baseline_test
names(XXX)
```

```{r}
# See all named elements of age_cd4_baseline_test
names(age_cd4_baseline_test)
```

5. Using the `XXX$XXX` notation, print only the correlation estimate (`estimate`) in your `age_cd4_baseline_test` object. What does this value tell you?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Print correlation coefficient estimate in the age_cd4_baseline_test object
XXX$XXX
```

```{r}
# Print correlation coefficient estimate
age_cd4_baseline_test$estimate
```

6. Again using the `XXX$XXX` notation, print only the p value (`p.value`) in your `age_cd4_baseline_test` object. What does this value tell you?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Print the p value of the correlation coefficient in the age_cd4_baseline_test object
XXX$XXX
```

```{r}
# Print the p value in the age_cd4_baseline_test object
age_cd4_baseline_test$conf.int
```

7. Again using the `XXX$XXX` notation, print only the confidence interval (`conf.int`) in your `age_cd4_baseline_test` object. What does this value tell you?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Print the confidence interval of the correlation coefficient in the age_cd4_baseline_test object
XXX$XXX
```

```{r}
# Print the confidence interval in the age_cd4_baseline_test object
age_cd4_baseline_test$conf.int
```

8. Using the `tidy()` function (from the `broom` package), create a 'tidy' version of your `age_cd4_baseline_test` object called `age_cd4_baseline_tidy`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create a 'tidy' version of my age_cd4_baseline_test object

age_cd4_baseline_tidy <- tidy(xxx)
```

```{r}
# Create a 'tidy' version of my age_cd4_baseline_test object

age_cd4_baseline_tidy <- tidy(age_cd4_baseline_test)
```

9. Now, print your `age_cd4_baseline_tidy` object, how do the results look?

```{r}
age_cd4_baseline_tidy
```

##### Correlation as Linear Model

10. Conduct the same analysis you did before, but this time use the `glm()` function. Use the code skeleton below to help you. Do you get the same results as you did using `cor.test()`?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# GLM predicting a patient's CD4 T cell count at baseline form their age at baseline 
age_cd4_baseline_glm <- glm(formula = XXX ~ XXX,
                    data = XXX)

# Print 'tidy' results
tidy(XXX)
```

```{r}
# GLM predicting a patient's CD4 T cell count at baseline form their age at baseline 
age_cd4_baseline_glm <- glm(formula = cd4_baseline ~ age,
                    data = trial)

# Print 'tidy' results
tidy(age_cd4_baseline_glm)
```

### C - T-test

> Research Question:
> Do patients with a history of intravenous drug use have higher CD4 T cell counts at baseline compared to patients without a history of intravenous drug use?

1. Using the code below, create a plot showing the distribution of CD4 T cell counts at baseline (`cd4_baseline`) depending on whether or not patients were symptomatic. Based on this plot, do you expect to find that symptomatic patients generally have higher (or lower) CD4 T cell counts?

```{r, eval= FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = trial, mapping = aes(x = symptomatic, y = cd4_baseline, col = symptomatic)) + 
  stat_summary(geom = "bar", fun.y = "mean", fill = "white", col = "black") +
  geom_jitter(width = .1, alpha = .1) +
  labs(title = "ACTG175 Trial",
       subtitle = "Baseline CD4 T cell count and symptoms",
       x = "Are patients symptomatic? (symptomatic)",
       y = "CD4 T cell count at baseline (cd4_baseline)") +
  guides(col = FALSE)
```

2. Using the `t.test()` function, create an object called `symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test` which conducts a two-sample t-test comparing patients' CD4 T cell count at baseline (`cd4_baseline`) between patients that are symptomatic and those that are not (`symptomatic`)

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# T-test comparing CD4 T cell counts at baseline bewteen symptomatic and non-symptomatic patients

XXX <- t.test(formula = XXX ~ XXX,
              data = XXX)
```

```{r}
# T-test comparing CD4 T cell counts at baseline bewteen symptomatic and non-symptomatic patients

symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test <- t.test(formula = cd4_baseline ~ symptomatic,
                           data = trial)
```

3. Print the `symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test` object to see summary outputs.

```{r}
age_cd4_baseline_test
```

4. Apply the `names()` function to your `symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test` object to see all of its named elements

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# See all named elements of symptom_cd4_baseline_test
names(XXX)
```

```{r}
# See all named elements of symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test
names(symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test)
```

5. Using the `XXX$XXX` notation, print only the correlation estimate (`estimate`) in your `symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test` object. What does the result tell you?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Print parameter estimates in the symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test object
XXX$XXX
```

```{r}
# Print parameter estimates in the symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test object
symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test$estimate
```

6. Again using the `XXX$XXX` notation, print only the p value (`p.value`) in your `symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test` object. What does this value tell you?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Print the p value of the symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test object
XXX$XXX
```

```{r}
# Print the p value in the symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test object
symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test$p.value
```

7. Again using the `XXX$XXX` notation, print only the confidence interval (`conf.int`) in your `symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test` object. What does this value tell you?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Print the confidence interval in the symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test object
XXX$XXX
```

```{r}
# Print the confidence interval in the symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test object
symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test$conf.int
```

8. Using the `tidy()` function (from the `broom` package), create a 'tidy' version of your `symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test` object called `symptomatic_cd4_baseline_tidy`

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Create a 'tidy' version of my symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test object

symptomatic_cd4_baseline_tidy <- tidy(xxx)
```

```{r}
# Create a 'tidy' version of my symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test object

symptomatic_cd4_baseline_tidy <- tidy(symptomatic_cd4_baseline_test)
```

9. Now, print your `symptomatic_cd4_baseline_tidy` object, how do the results look?

```{r}
symptomatic_cd4_baseline_tidy
```

##### T-test as Linear Model

10. Conduct the same analysis you did before, but this time use the `glm()` function. Use the code skeleton below to help you. Do you get the same results as you did using `t.test()`? Which outputs are the same and which are different?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# GLM predicting a patient's CD4 T cell count at baseline form their age at baseline 
symptomatic_cd4_baseline_glm <- glm(formula = XXX ~ XXX,
                                    data = XXX)

# Print 'tidy' results
tidy(XXX)
```

```{r}
# GLM predicting a patient's CD4 T cell count at baseline form their age at baseline 
symptomatic_cd4_baseline_glm <- glm(formula = cd4_baseline ~ symptomatic,
                        data = trial)

# Print 'tidy' results
tidy(symptomatic_cd4_baseline_glm)
```

### D - ANOVA

> Research Question:
> Was there a difference between the treatment molecule in the number of days until the first occurrence of one of the following major negative events: (i) a decline in CD4 T cell count of at least 50 (ii) an event indicating progression to AIDS, or (iii) death?

1. Using the code below, create a plot showing the distribution of the number of days until a major negative event (`days`) for each treatment molecule `molecule` Based on this plot, do you expect to find that there were differences in treatment molecules?

```{r, eval= FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = trial, mapping = aes(x = molecule, y = days, col = molecule)) + 
  stat_summary(geom = "bar", fun.y = "mean", fill = "white", col = "black") +
  geom_jitter(width = .2, alpha = .2) +
  labs(title = "ACTG175 Trial",
       subtitle = "Baseline CD4 T cell count and symptoms",
       x = "Treatment Arm (molecule)",
       y = "Number of days until a major negative event (days)") +
  guides(col = FALSE)
```

2. Using the `aov()` function, create an object called `days_molecule_aov` which conducts an ANOVA comparing the number of days until a negative event (`days`) between treatment molecule (`molecule`).

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# ANOVA comparing number of days until a negative event between treatment molecule

XXX <- aov(formula = XXX ~ XXX,
              data = XXX)
```

```{r}
# ANOVA comparing number of days until a negative event between treatment molecule

days_molecule_aov <- aov(formula = days ~ molecule,
                      data = trial)
```

3. Print the `days_molecule_aov` object to see summary outputs.

```{r}
days_molecule_aov
```

4. Apply the `names()` function to your `days_molecule_aov` object to see all of its named elements

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# See all named elements of days_molecule_aov
names(XXX)
```

```{r}
# See all named elements of symptom_cd4_baseline_test
names(days_molecule_aov)
```

5. Using the `XXX$XXX` notation, print the coefficients in your `days_molecule_aov` object. What do these values mean?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Print coefficients in the days_molecule_aov object
XXX$XXX
```

```{r}
# Print coefficients in the days_molecule_aov object
days_molecule_aov$coefficients
```

7. Using the `tidy()` function (from the `broom` package), create a 'tidy' version of your `days_molecule_aov` object called `days_molecule_tidy`

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Create a 'tidy' version of my symptom_cd4_baseline_test days_molecule_aov

days_molecule_tidy <- tidy(xxx)
```

```{r}
# Create a 'tidy' version of my days_molecule_aov object

days_molecule_tidy <- tidy(days_molecule_aov)
```

9. Now, print your `days_molecule_tidy` object, how do the results look?

```{r}
days_molecule_tidy
```

##### Post-hoc tests

10. In order to compare pair-wise differences between groups after conducting an ANOVA, you need to conduct post-hoc tests. Using the `TukeyHSD()` function, conduct pair-wise tests to see which pairs of treatment molecule differ in `days`. Save the result to an object called `days_molecule_aov_post`
`
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Conduct pair-wise tests comparing every pair of treatment
#  molecule (molecule) on days until a major negative event (days)

XXX <- TukeyHSD(XXX)
```

```{r}
# Conduct pair-wise tests comparing every pair of treatment
#  molecule (molecule) on days until a major negative event (days)

days_molecule_aov_post <- TukeyHSD(days_molecule_aov)
```

11. Print your `days_molecule_aov_post` object, what do you see?

12. Print 'tidy' results from your `days_molecule_aov_post` object using the `tidy()` function

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Print 'tidy' version of days_molecule_aov_post
tidy(XXX)
```

13. Based on what you've seen, what are your conclusions? Which treatment molecule seem to differ?

##### ANOVA as Linear Model

10. Conduct the same analysis you did before, but this time use the `glm()` function. Use the code skeleton below to help you. Do you get the same results as you did using `aov()`? Which outputs are the same and which are different?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# GLM predicting number of days until a major negative event (days) as a function of treatment arm (molecule)
XXX <- glm(formula = XXX ~ XXX,
           data = XXX)

# Print object
XXX

# Print 'tidy' results
tidy(XXX)
```

```{r}
# GLM predicting number of days until a major negative event (days) as a function of treatment arm (molecule)
days_molecule_glm <- glm(formula = days ~ molecule,
                     data = trial)

# Print object
days_molecule_glm

# Print 'tidy' results
tidy(days_molecule_glm)
```

### F - Regression

1. It's time to conduct a regression analysis predicting day the number of days until a major negative event `days` based on several variables. Perform a regression analysis predicting days until a major negative event `days` based on the following variables: `molecule`, `gender`, `age`, `weight_kg`, `drug_history`, `race`, `cd4_baseline`, and `cd8_baseline`. Use the code chunk below to help you

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Predict days based on many variables

days_glm <- glm(formula = XXX ~ XXX + XXX + XXX ...,
                data = XXX)
```

```{r}
# Predict days based on many variables

days_glm <- glm(formula = days ~ molecule + gender + age + weight_kg + drug_history + race + cd4_baseline + cd8_baseline,
                data = trial)
```

2. Using `tidy()` look at the summary results. Which variables seem to be able to predict the number of days until a major negative event?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
tidy(XXX)
```


```{r}
tidy(days_glm)
```

3. Using `rsq()` calculate the r-squared value of your model. Was it high or low? Recall that r-squared can range anywhere from 0 (meaning the model explains *none* of the variance in `days`), all the way up to 1 (meaning the model expllains *all* of the variance in `days`). 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
rsq(XXX)
```

```{r}
rsq(days_glm)
```

4. Using the code below, visualise the residuals from the model. What does this mean?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Save residuals as days_glm_resid
days_glm_resid <- resid(days_glm)

# Plot histogram
ggplot(data = tibble(days_glm_resid), aes(x = days_glm_resid)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "white", fill = "skyblue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  labs(title = "Residuals of regression model predicting days",
       x = "Absolute residuals abs(Fit - Truth)",
       y = 'Frequency')
```

5. Using the code below, calculate the mean absolute residuals from the model. What do these mean?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Calculate the mean absolute residuals of the model
mean(abs(resid(XXX)))
```

6. Using the code below, visualise the *absolute* residuals from the model. What does this mean?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Save residuals as days_glm_resid
days_glm_absresid <- abs(resid(days_glm))

# Plot histogram
ggplot(data = tibble(days_glm_absresid), aes(x = days_glm_absresid)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "white", fill = "skyblue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  labs(title = "Absolute residuals of regression model predicting days",
       x = "Absolute residuals abs(Fit - Truth)",
       y = 'Frequency')
```

7. Using the code below, calculate the mean absolute residuals from the model. What do these mean?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Calculate the mean absolute residuals of the model
mean(abs(resid(XXX)))
```

### X - Advanced: Choose your own test!

For the remaining tasks, you choose the test!  For each task, do the following:

- Visualize the data (use the code given in the sections above for help!)
- Conduct the appropriate test using an applied hypothesis test function (i.e.; correlation test, t-test, ANOVA or chi-square test).
- Explore the results (e.g.; estimate, confidence interval, p-value).
- Conduct the same test using the generalized linear model function `glm()`
- Explore the results and confirm you get the same result from your applied function!

1. Do people with a history of intravenous drug use (`drug_history`) tend to have major negative events (`days`) faster than those without a history of intravenous drug use?

2. Do men and women (`gender`) have different CD8 T cell counts at baseline (`cd8_baseline`)?

3. Is there a relationship between patient's CD4 T cell counts at baseline (`cd4_baseline`) and at 96 weeks (`cd4_96_weeks`)?

4. Did older patients have higher CD4 T cell counts at baseline (`cd4_baseline`) compared to younger patients?

5. Was there an effect of treatment arm (`molecule`) on the *change* of CD4 T cell counts between baseline (`cd4_baseline`) and 96 weeks (`cd4_96_weeks)? Hint: to do this, you first need to create a column that shows the change in CD4 T cell counts. The code below should help you with this:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
trial <- trial %>%
  mutate(cd4_96_weeks_change = cd4_96_weeks - cd4_baseline)   # Add cd4_96_weeks_change to trial, indicating change from
                                        # in cd4 T cell count from baseline to 96 weeks.
```

### Y - Advanced: Chi-square test

> Research Question:
> Was there an unequal distribution of gender in the treatment molecule?

1. Using the code below, create a plot showing the percentage of patients who were male (`gender == "Male")` for each treatment arm `molecule`. Based on this plot, do you expect to find that there were differences in treatment molecule?

```{r, eval= FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Calculate percentage of Male in each treatment arm

arm_gender <- trial %>%
  group_by(molecule) %>%
  summarise(male_p = mean(gender == "Male"))

ggplot(data = arm_gender, mapping = aes(x = molecule, y = male_p)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  ylim(c(0, 1)) +
  labs(title = "ACTG175 AIDS trial",
       subtitle = "Percent of males in each treatment arm",
       x = "Treatment Arm (molecule)",
       y = "Percent Male (gender)")
```

2. Using the `chisq.test()` function, create an object called `gender_arm_test` which conducts a chi-square test comparing the frequencies of each gender (`gender`) for each level of molecule (`molecule`).

- Note: The `chisq.test()` function (unfortunately) does not support formulas, so we have to enter the data in as two separate (factor) vectors:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Chi-square test comparing the frequencies of each gender for each treatment arm

XXX <- chisq.test(x = factor(trial$XXX),
                  y = factor(trial$XXX))
```

```{r}
# Chi-square test comparing the frequencies of each gender for each treatment arm

gender_arm_test <- chisq.test(x = factor(trial$gender),
                              y = factor(trial$molecule))
```

3. Print the `gender_arm_test` object to see summary outputs.

```{r}
gender_arm_test
```

4. Apply the `names()` function to your `gender_arm_test` object to see all of its named elements

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# See all named elements of gender_arm_test
names(XXX)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# See all named elements of gender_arm_test
names(gender_arm_test)
```

5. Using the `XXX$XXX` notation, print the *observed* frequencies in your `gender_arm_test` object. What do these values mean?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Print observed frequencies in the gender_arm_test object
XXX$XXX
```

```{r}
# Print observed frequencies in the gender_arm_test object
gender_arm_test$observed
```

6. Using the `XXX$XXX` notation, print the *expected* frequencies in your `gender_arm_test` object. What do these values mean?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Print expected frequencies in the gender_arm_test object
XXX$XXX
```

```{r}
# Print expected frequencies in the gender_arm_test object
gender_arm_test$expected
```

7. Using the `tidy()` function (from the `broom` package), create a 'tidy' version of your `gender_arm_test` object called `gender_arm_tidy`

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Create a 'tidy' version of my gender_arm_test called gender_arm_tidy

gender_arm_tidy <- tidy(xxx)
```

```{r}
# Create a 'tidy' version of my gender_arm_test object

gender_arm_tidy <- tidy(gender_arm_test)
```

9. Now, print your `gender_arm_tidy` object, how do the results look?

```{r}
gender_arm_tidy
```

##### Chi-square as Linear Model

10. In the next section we'll compare the `chisq.test()` result to one using `glm()`. However, before we do, we need to restructure the data a bit. Run the following code to create a dataframe containing the counts for each combination of molecule and gender:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Create a dataframe showing counts for each combination of
#  molecule and gender

molecule_gender_counts <- trial %>%
                      group_by(molecule, gender) %>%
                      summarise(counts = n())
```

11. Print your `molecule_gender_counts` object to see how it looks. What do the results mean?

12. Conduct the same analysis you did before, but this time use the `glm()` function. Use the code skeleton below to help you. Do you get the same results as you did using `chisq.test()`? Which outputs are the same and which are different?

- Be sure to model `counts` based on the *interaction* between `molecule` and `gender` using `formula = counts ~ molecule * gender`. 
- We'll summarise the results of the model using the `anova()` function with the argument `test = "Rao"` to specify that we are conducting a score test (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_test for details)

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Create linear model predicting counts as a function of the 
#  interaction between molecule and gender

molecule_gender_glm <- glm(formula = XXX ~ XXX * XXX, # Model counts by the interaction of molecule and gender
                       family = "poisson",        # Use poisson model family to specify we are modelling counts
                       data = XXX)

# Print summary results as an anova table
anova(molecule_gender_glm, 
      test = 'Rao')   # Show a 'Rao" score test
```


```{r}
# Create linear model predicting counts as a function of the 
#  interaction between molecule and gender

molecule_gender_glm <- glm(formula = counts ~ molecule * gender, 
                       family = "poisson", 
                       data = molecule_gender_counts)

# Print summary results as an anova table
anova(molecule_gender_glm, 
      test = 'Rao')   # Show a 'Rao" score test
```

The `trial_ACTG175.csv` data from the ACTG 175 clinical trial. ACTG 175 was a randomized clinical trial to compare monotherapy with zidovudine or didanosine with combination therapy with zidovudine and didanosine or zidovudine and zalcitabine in adults infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type I whose CD4 T cell counts were between 200 and 500 per cubic millimeter.

The trial is documented in Hammer SM, et al. (1996), "A trial comparing nucleoside monotherapy with combination therapy in HIV-infected adults with CD4 cell counts from 200 to 500 per cubic millimeter.", New England Journal of Medicine, 335:1081–1090. The full publication can be found at https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199610103351501

The data were originally obtained from the `speff2trial` package.
